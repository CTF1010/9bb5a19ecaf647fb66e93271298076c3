# I hope i didn't forget anything

### If you are looking for something, you came to the wrong spot.

### This is my online journal

I might make a facebook account, but only boomers are still on it.
I missed the twitter thing with blue checks. It was a bad idea anyway, I expected the thing to start a scam, but not such a big one

### Oh, of course I forgot something

I keep forgetting to tell my friends to come with me to that mausoleum...

I will remind them once, don't worry.

Hope they will enjoy!
